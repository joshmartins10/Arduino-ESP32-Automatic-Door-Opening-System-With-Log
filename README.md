# Arduino-ESP32-Automatic-Door-Opening-System-With-Log

*This project makes use of a couple of libraries contained in the lib folder to achieve 
making a simulated miniaturized door to open automatically and close only when the person 
that entered has gone past a certain point. This feature ensures that the door does not slam 
close on someone going through the door. It also takes a log that is sent to thingsboard and thingspeak cloud.
Some of the tools used in the code referenced several snippets from other work done by other people so the idea is mine 
but the implementation used resources from other codes*
